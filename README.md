# Project 3 - *FullPlate*

**Name of your app** is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height.
- [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
- [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Search results page
   - [ ] Infinite scroll for restaurant results.
   - [ ] Implement map view of restaurant results.
- [ ] Implement the restaurant detail page.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

### Basic Yelp client

This is a headless example of how to implement an OAuth 1.0a Yelp API client. The Yelp API provides an application token that allows applications to make unauthenticated requests to their search API.

### Next steps

- Check out `BusinessesViewController.swift` to see how to use the `Business` model.

### Sample request

**Basic search with query**

```
Business.searchWithTerm("Thai", completion: { (businesses: [Business]!, error: NSError!) -> Void in
    self.businesses = businesses
    
    for business in businesses {
        print(business.name!)
        print(business.address!)
    }
})
```

**Advanced search with categories, sort, and deal filters**

```
Business.searchWithTerm("Restaurants", sort: .Distance, categories: ["asianfusion", "burgers"], deals: true) { (businesses: [Business]!, error: NSError!) -> Void in

    for business in businesses {
        print(business.name!)
        print(business.address!)
    }
}
```
